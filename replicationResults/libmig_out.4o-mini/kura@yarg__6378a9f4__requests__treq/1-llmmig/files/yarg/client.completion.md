### Explanation of Changes
To migrate the code from using the `requests` library to the `treq` library, the following changes were made:

1. **Import Statement**: The import statement for `requests` was replaced with `import treq`.
2. **Session Management**: The `requests.Session()` object was removed since `treq` does not require a session object for making requests.
3. **Request Method**: The `session.get()` method was replaced with `treq.get()`, which directly makes a GET request.
4. **Response Handling**: The response handling remains largely the same, but we directly use the response from `treq.get()`.

Here is the modified code:
