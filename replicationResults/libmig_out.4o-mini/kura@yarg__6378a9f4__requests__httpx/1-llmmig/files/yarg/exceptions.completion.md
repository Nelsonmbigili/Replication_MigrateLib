### Explanation of Changes

To migrate the code from using the `requests` library to the `httpx` library, the following changes were made:

1. **Import Statement**: The import statement for `HTTPError` was changed from `requests.exceptions` to `httpx`.
2. **Exception Handling**: The `HTTPError` class now inherits from `httpx.HTTPStatusError` instead of `requests.exceptions.HTTPError`. This is because `httpx` has its own set of exceptions that are more suitable for its context.

The rest of the code remains unchanged to adhere to the guidelines provided.
