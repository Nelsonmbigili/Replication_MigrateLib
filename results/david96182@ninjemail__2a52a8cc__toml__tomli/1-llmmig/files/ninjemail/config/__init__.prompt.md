The following Python code currently uses the library "toml" version 0.10.2.
Migrate this code to use the library "tomli" version 2.2.1 instead.

**Instructions:**
1. **Explain the Changes**: Begin the output with a brief explanation of the specific changes you made to migrate from "toml" to "tomli".
2. **Provide the Modified Code**: After the explanation, present the modified code. Provide the entire code after migration even if only a part of it is changed.

**Important Guidelines**:
- Only make changes directly related to migrating between "toml" and "tomli".
- Do not refactor, reformat, optimize, or alter the original coding style.
- The code given to you is part of a larger application. Do not change the names of classes, functions, or variables, because it can break the application.

Original code:
```python
import toml
import os

# Load configuration from the TOML file
config_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), '..', 'config.toml')
config = toml.load(config_path)

# Expose configuration variables as module-level variables
CAPTCHA_SERVICES_SUPPORTED = config.get("CAPTCHA_SERVICES_SUPPORTED", [])
DEFAULT_CAPTCHA_SERVICE = config.get("DEFAULT_CAPTCHA_SERVICE", "")
SMS_SERVICES_SUPPORTED = config.get("SMS_SERVICES_SUPPORTED", [])
DEFAULT_SMS_SERVICE = config.get("DEFAULT_SMS_SERVICE", "")
SUPPORTED_BROWSERS = config.get("SUPPORTED_BROWSERS", [])

SUPPORTED_SOLVERS_BY_EMAIL = {}
for item in config['SUPPORTED_SOLVERS_BY_EMAIL']:
    email_service = item['email_service']
    solvers = item['solvers']
    SUPPORTED_SOLVERS_BY_EMAIL[email_service] = solvers

```
