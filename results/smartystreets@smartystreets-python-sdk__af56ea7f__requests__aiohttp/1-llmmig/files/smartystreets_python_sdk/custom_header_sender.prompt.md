The following Python code currently uses the library "requests" version 2.32.3.
Migrate this code to use the library "aiohttp" version 3.11.16 instead.

**Instructions:**
1. **Explain the Changes**: Begin the output with a brief explanation of the specific changes you made to migrate from "requests" to "aiohttp".
2. **Provide the Modified Code**: After the explanation, present the modified code. Provide the entire code after migration even if only a part of it is changed.

**Important Guidelines**:
- Only make changes directly related to migrating between "requests" and "aiohttp".
- Do not refactor, reformat, optimize, or alter the original coding style.
- The code given to you is part of a larger application. Do not change the names of classes, functions, or variables, because it can break the application.

Original code:
```python
from requests import Request


class CustomHeaderSender:
    def __init__(self, headers, inner):
        self.headers = headers
        self.inner = inner

    def send(self, smarty_request):
        request = self.build_request(smarty_request)
        return self.inner.send(request)

    def build_request(self, smarty_request):
        request = Request(url=smarty_request.url_prefix, params=smarty_request.parameters)
        request.headers = self.headers
        if smarty_request.payload:
            request.data = smarty_request.payload
            request.method = 'POST'
        else:
            request.method = 'GET'
        return request

```
