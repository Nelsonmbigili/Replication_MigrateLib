The provided code does not contain any usage of `matplotlib` for plotting or visualization. Instead, it uses `matplotlib.font_manager.FontProperties` to handle font properties, and there is no visualization or plotting logic present. The `altair` library is a data visualization library and does not provide functionality for managing font properties or replacing `matplotlib.font_manager`.

Since the code does not involve any plotting or visualization tasks, there is no need to migrate it to use `altair`. The `altair` library is not relevant to the functionality demonstrated in the provided code.

If you have additional code that involves plotting or visualization with `matplotlib`, please provide that portion, and I can assist in migrating it to `altair`.
