### Explanation of Changes:
The provided code does not directly use the `requests` library, so there is no need to migrate it to `requests_futures`. The code defines custom exception classes and does not include any HTTP request logic. Since the migration request is specific to replacing `requests` with `requests_futures`, and no such usage exists in the provided code, no changes are necessary.

If there were any HTTP requests using `requests` in the code, they would need to be replaced with asynchronous requests using `requests_futures`. However, since this is not the case here, the code remains unchanged.

### Modified Code:
```python
'''
navertalk.exceptions module
'''
from __future__ import unicode_literals

class BaseError(Exception):
    """Base Exception class"""

    def __init__(self, message='-'):

        """
        return '<%s [%s]>' % (self.__class__.__name__, self.message)

        """
        super(NaverTalkApiError, self).__init__(api_response.result_message)

        self._status_code = 200
        self.result_code = api_response.result_code

    @property
    def status_code(self):
        """

    def __init__(self, response):
        """___init__ method.

        Args:
            - response: models.response
        """
        super(NaverTalkApiConnectionError, self).__init__(response.text)

        self.status_code = response.status_code
        self.response = response


class NaverTalkPaymentError(BaseError):
    """
    Exception for handling Payment to fail easily
    for example when pay event occurred for some stuff and the stuff running out,
    raise NaverTalkPaymentError and catch exception to make another action
    """
    def __init__(self, message='-'):
        """ __init__ method.

        Args:
            - message:
        """
        super(NaverTalkPaymentError, self).__init__(message)
```

No changes were made because the code does not use the `requests` library, and therefore, there is no need to migrate to `requests_futures`.
