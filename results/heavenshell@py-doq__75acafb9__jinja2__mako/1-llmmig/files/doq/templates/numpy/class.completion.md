### Explanation of the Changes:
To migrate from "jinja2" to "mako", the following changes were made:
1. The syntax for variable interpolation in "jinja2" (`{{ variable }}`) was replaced with the "mako" syntax (`${variable}`).
2. Since the provided code snippet is a template string, no additional changes (e.g., imports or rendering logic) were necessary in this specific case.

### Modified Code:
```python
"""${name}.
"""
```
