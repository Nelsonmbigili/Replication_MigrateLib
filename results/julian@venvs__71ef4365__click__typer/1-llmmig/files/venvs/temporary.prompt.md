The following Python code currently uses the library "click" version 8.1.7.
Migrate this code to use the library "typer" version 0.15.2 instead.

**Instructions:**
1. **Explain the Changes**: Begin the output with a brief explanation of the specific changes you made to migrate from "click" to "typer".
2. **Provide the Modified Code**: After the explanation, present the modified code. Provide the entire code after migration even if only a part of it is changed.

**Important Guidelines**:
- Only make changes directly related to migrating between "click" and "typer".
- Do not refactor, reformat, optimize, or alter the original coding style.
- The code given to you is part of a larger application. Do not change the names of classes, functions, or variables, because it can break the application.

Original code:
```python
"""
CLI for managing a global temporary virtual environment.
"""

import click

from venvs.common import _FILESYSTEM, _ROOT
from venvs.create import _INSTALL, _REQUIREMENTS


@_FILESYSTEM
@_ROOT
@_INSTALL
@_REQUIREMENTS
def main(filesystem, locator, installs, requirements):
    """
    Create or reuse the global temporary virtualenv.
    """
    temporary = locator.temporary()
    click.echo(temporary.binary("python").dirname())
    temporary.recreate_on(filesystem=filesystem)
    temporary.install(packages=installs, requirements=requirements)

```
