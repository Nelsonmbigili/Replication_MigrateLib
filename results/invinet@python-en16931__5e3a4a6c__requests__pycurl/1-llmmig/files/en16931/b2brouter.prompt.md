The following Python code currently uses the library "requests" version 2.32.3.
Migrate this code to use the library "pycurl" version 7.45.6 instead.

**Instructions:**
1. **Explain the Changes**: Begin the output with a brief explanation of the specific changes you made to migrate from "requests" to "pycurl".
2. **Provide the Modified Code**: After the explanation, present the modified code. Provide the entire code after migration even if only a part of it is changed.

**Important Guidelines**:
- Only make changes directly related to migrating between "requests" and "pycurl".
- Do not refactor, reformat, optimize, or alter the original coding style.
- The code given to you is part of a larger application. Do not change the names of classes, functions, or variables, because it can break the application.
