The following Python code currently uses the library "matplotlib" version 3.10.1.
Migrate this code to use the library "plotly" version 6.0.1 instead.

**Instructions:**
1. **Explain the Changes**: Begin the output with a brief explanation of the specific changes you made to migrate from "matplotlib" to "plotly".
2. **Provide the Modified Code**: After the explanation, present the modified code. Provide the entire code after migration even if only a part of it is changed.

**Important Guidelines**:
- Only make changes directly related to migrating between "matplotlib" and "plotly".
- Do not refactor, reformat, optimize, or alter the original coding style.
- The code given to you is part of a larger application. Do not change the names of classes, functions, or variables, because it can break the application.

Original code:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pytest


@pytest.fixture(scope='module', autouse=True)
def clear_previous_plot():
    plt.cla()

```
