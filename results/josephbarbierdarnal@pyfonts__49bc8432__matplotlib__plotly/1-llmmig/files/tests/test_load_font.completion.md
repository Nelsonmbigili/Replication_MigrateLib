The provided code does not use `matplotlib` for plotting or visualization purposes. Instead, it imports `FontProperties` from `matplotlib.font_manager` to validate font properties. Since the code does not involve any plotting or visualization, there is no need to migrate it to `plotly`. The `plotly` library is primarily used for creating interactive visualizations, and it does not provide a direct equivalent to `matplotlib.font_manager.FontProperties`.

Thus, no changes are necessary to migrate this code to `plotly`. The code is already functional as is, and replacing `matplotlib.font_manager.FontProperties` with `plotly` would not make sense in this context.

If you have additional code that involves actual plotting or visualization, please provide it, and I can assist with the migration.
