The following Python code currently uses the library "requests" version 2.32.3.
Migrate this code to use the library "httpx" version 0.28.1 instead.

**Instructions:**
1. **Explain the Changes**: Begin the output with a brief explanation of the specific changes you made to migrate from "requests" to "httpx".
2. **Provide the Modified Code**: After the explanation, present the modified code. Provide the entire code after migration even if only a part of it is changed.

**Important Guidelines**:
- Only make changes directly related to migrating between "requests" and "httpx".
- Do not refactor, reformat, optimize, or alter the original coding style.
- The code given to you is part of a larger application. Do not change the names of classes, functions, or variables, because it can break the application.

Original code:
```python
from requests import HTTPError


class MockResponse:
    def __init__(self, data: dict | list, status_code: int, content: any = None):
        self.__data = data
        self.content = content
        self.status_code = status_code

    def json(self):
        return self.__data

    def raise_for_status(self):
        """
        This is meant to closely resemble the actual raise_for_status method found here:
        https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/requests/models/#Response.raise_for_status
        """
        http_error_msg = ""
        if 400 <= self.status_code < 500:
            http_error_msg = f"{self.status_code} Client Error"

        elif 500 <= self.status_code < 600:
            http_error_msg = f"{self.status_code} Server Error"

        if http_error_msg:
            raise HTTPError(http_error_msg, response=self)

```
